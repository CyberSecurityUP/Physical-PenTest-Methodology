## What is Physical PenTest?

breaking into your organization. Physical threats that could be simulated include bypassing door locks, stealing devices, or using social engineering to convince an employee to let them inside a server room.
While many businesses do an excellent job of protecting their network and applications against the threat of a virtual cyber-attack, many organizations don't consider the risk associated with a possible physical attack on their locations.

## Physical PenTest Benefits

The primary benefit of a physical penetration test is to expose weaknesses and vulnerabilities in physical controls (locks, barriers, cameras, or sensors) so that flaws can be quickly addressed. In addition, physical penetration tests mimic real-world scenarios to demonstrate what impact a malicious actor can have on your systems.

Physical security penetration testing, when performed properly, will strengthen your security defenses and allow you to focus on the digital side of your security. It makes no sense to throw millions of dollars on security tools if an attacker can get inside your company buildings and slip out unnoticed.market equilibrium, where threat actors are becoming better at tailoring their demands to what their victims are most likely to pay given the growth of recovery cost and the risk of reputational damage from public data leaks.

## Rule of Engagements

The Rules of Engagement, or ROE, are meant to list out the specifics of your penetration testing project to ensure that both the client and the engineers working on a project know exactly what is being testing, when its being tested, and how its being tested.
Define the tests that will be performed on your target, defining processes and prioritizing the most important areas.

## Methodology

### Planning

1. Gather Scoping Information
After initiating the project, scoping/target information will be collected from the client. In the case of physical penetration testing, this information will include the addresses of target locations, compromise goals to help us focus our attacks, and information that can help us prevent issues, such as areas of the building that are off-limits and alarm instructions.

2. Review Rules of Engagement
This process will involve a brief meeting with the client to review and acknowledge the penetration testing rules of engagement, confirm project scope and testing timeline, identify specific testing objectives, document any testing limitations or restrictions, and answer any questions related to the project. Additionally, the client will sign a “Get out of Jail” card that the test team can use to show they are authorized to be testing, should they be caught.

### Execution

1. Reconnaissance
Once the test has officially begun, a start notification will be sent to the client. The first phase will involve gathering as much information about the target location as possible. This process will start before the engineers are even on-site. They will search open-source intelligence to try to gather information to help them blend-in to the environment. This will include things like the normal attire for employees, if there are employee badges easily accessible, evaluating the various egress routes from Google Maps, trying to identify favorite restaurants of employees where a badge can be read, etc.
Further reconnaissance will be conducted once the engineers are on-site. During this time, the engineers will identify the various ways to enter the building, conduct traffic pattern analysis, and evaluate the physical security controls present from outside the facility.

2. Threat Modeling
For this assessment, the threat modeling phase serves to evaluate the different attack vectors that may lead to accessing the building. The types of attacks and likelihood of these threats materializing will serve to inform risk rankings/priorities and outline the attack plan going forward. In a typical physical penetration test, the goal is to identify the level of risk to an organization. As such, Triaxiom will start with the attack vector that has the least amount of risk. Once they gain access, if they remain uncaught, they will exit the building, and then try a different attack vector a few hours later. Each attack will be slightly less sophisticated until the engineer is caught. This allows the organization to quantify the level of risk they have.

### Post Exploitation

- After successfully gaining access to a facility, Triaxiom will continue to take actions to evaluate and demonstrate the risk. Some of the areas that will be evaluated after gaining access include:
- Network Access Controls – Can Triaxiom gain access to the network and elevate permissions?
- Clean Desk Policy – Can Triaxiom find information which could be detrimental to the company if found? This includes items such as passwords, written down credit card information, etc.
- Employee Challenges – Triaxiom will walk around the facility and see if employees will challenge a visitor they don’t recognize.
- After-Hours Access – Triaxiom will attempt to remain in the facility after all employees leave for the day.
- Sensitive Area Access – Triaxiom will attempt to further their access and gain access to other sensitive areas within the facility, such as a datacenter or server room.

### Post Execution
1. Reporting
After completing the active potion of the assessment, Triaxiom will formally document the findings. The output provided will generally include an executive-level report and a technical findings report. The executive-level report is written for management consumption and includes a high-level overview of assessment activities, scope, most critical/thematic issues discovered, overall risk scoring, organizational security strengths, and applicable pictures from the assessment. The technical findings report, on the other hand, will include all vulnerabilities listed individually, with details as to how to recreate the issue, understand the risk, recommended remediation actions, and helpful reference links.

2. Quality Assurance
All assessments go through a rigorous technical and editorial quality assurance phase. This may also include follow-ups with the client to confirm or deny environment details, as appropriate.

3. Presentation
The final activity in any assessment and the last step in our physical penetration testing methodology is a presentation of all documentation to the client. Triaxiom will walk the client through the information provided, make any updates needed, and address questions regarding the assessment output. Following this activity, we’ll provide new revisions of documentation and schedule any formal retesting, if applicable.
